# SmallRayTracer
Make a ray tracer in as few lines as possible. Also will be used to test more features without messing up the origional ray tracing repo

The overall goal is to test more features before adding them to the OpenGL version. Currently testing lighting and multiple bounces. 
Will start working with diffuse and Specular reflections soon and different materials.
