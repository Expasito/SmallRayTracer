# SmallRayTracer
Make a ray tracer in as few lines as possible. Also will be used to test more features without messing up the origional ray tracing repo

The overall goal is to test more features before adding them to the OpenGL version. Currently testing lighting and multiple bounces. 
Will start working with diffuse and Specular reflections soon and different materials. 

Here is the current status. We have a light source which is illuminating the world. There is a triangle in the center of the screen that is being covered by another triangle of the exact same size but a very small dz forward to prevent any light from hitting it. The light source is just above the top-most triangle to have it and the other triangles cast shadows.
